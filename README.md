# Hi there :coffee:

Hello there! I'm Arthur, a programmer with a passion for automation and making life
more bearable. I love tinkering with code and exploring new technologies, and I'm
always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn something new. Feel free to
check out my repositories and drop me a message if you'd like to collaborate on
something cool.
